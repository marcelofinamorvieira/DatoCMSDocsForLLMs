# Advanced Topics

This section covers advanced patterns and best practices for building sophisticated DatoCMS plugins. These guides go beyond basic plugin development to help you create performant, maintainable, and feature-rich plugins.

## Guides

### [Plugin Memory Management](./plugin-memory-management.md)
Learn how to prevent memory leaks, manage resources efficiently, and ensure optimal plugin performance through proper memory management techniques.

**Topics covered:**
- Event listener and timer cleanup
- React-specific memory patterns
- Resource pooling and caching strategies
- Memory profiling and debugging
- Common memory leak patterns and solutions

### [Plugin Performance Optimization](./plugin-performance.md)
Optimize your plugins for speed and responsiveness with techniques for bundle size reduction, rendering optimization, and efficient data handling.

**Topics covered:**
- Bundle size optimization and code splitting
- React rendering optimization techniques
- API and network optimization patterns
- Frame and sizing performance
- Performance monitoring and metrics

### [Plugin Testing Guide](./plugin-testing.md)
Comprehensive testing strategies for DatoCMS plugins, including unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing approaches.

**Topics covered:**
- Testing environment setup
- Mocking the SDK context
- Component and hook testing
- E2E testing with Playwright
- Continuous integration setup

### [Multi-Hook Patterns](./multi-hook-patterns.md)
Learn how to build complex plugins that leverage multiple hooks to create integrated functionality across different areas of the CMS.

**Topics covered:**
- Common multi-hook patterns
- State sharing between hooks
- Complete workflow integration
- Event coordination patterns
- Best practices for complex plugins

### [Plugin State Management](./plugin-state-management.md)
Master state management in DatoCMS plugins with patterns for local state, persistent storage, and cross-instance synchronization.

**Topics covered:**
- State management challenges and solutions
- React state patterns and Context API
- Persistent storage strategies
- State synchronization techniques
- Performance considerations

## When to Use These Guides

- **Building production plugins**: These patterns are essential for plugins used in production environments
- **Complex plugin requirements**: When your plugin needs multiple features or sophisticated interactions
- **Performance issues**: If you're experiencing slowness or memory problems
- **Team development**: These patterns help maintain code quality in team environments
- **Long-term maintenance**: Following these practices makes plugins easier to maintain and extend

## Key Principles

1. **Performance First**: Always consider the performance impact of your code
2. **Memory Awareness**: Clean up resources and prevent memory leaks
3. **Testability**: Write code that's easy to test and maintain
4. **User Experience**: Optimize for smooth, responsive interactions
5. **Maintainability**: Use patterns that make code easier to understand and modify
